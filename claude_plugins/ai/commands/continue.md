Execution rules:
- Default to foreground execution.
- Default provider is `deepseek` unless the user specifies `--provider <name>`.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary around the agent output. Return it verbatim.
- If the user did not supply a request, ask what should be investigated or fixed.
